## Tiny Blockchain in Python
A minimal blockchain implementation in Python, demonstrating how transactions, mining, and proof-of-work function in a decentralized network.

# Features
ðŸ”¹ Simple Blockchain Structure â€“ Blocks contain an index, timestamp, transactions, proof (nonce), and the previous blockâ€™s hash.
ðŸ”¹ Proof of Work (PoW) â€“ Implements a basic consensus mechanism to prevent spam and ensure valid block mining.
ðŸ”¹ Mining Functionality â€“ Nodes can mine new blocks and receive rewards.
ðŸ”¹ Transaction Handling â€“ Users can add transactions to the blockchain.
ðŸ”¹ REST API with Flask â€“ Provides endpoints for interacting with the blockchain (adding transactions, mining blocks, and viewing the chain).
ðŸ”¹ Decentralized Design â€“ Each node maintains a copy of the blockchain and syncs with others.

# How It Works
A user submits a transaction.
Miners validate and add the transaction to a block.
Miners solve a cryptographic puzzle (Proof of Work).
The block is added to the blockchain and distributed across the network.
# Running the Project
Clone the Repository

Interact via API using tools like Postman or cURL.
## API Endpoints
GET /chain â€“ View the blockchain.
POST /transactions/new â€“ Add a new transaction.
GET /mine â€“ Mine a new block.
POST /nodes/register â€“ Register new blockchain nodes.
GET /nodes/resolve â€“ Consensus mechanism to resolve chain conflicts.
## Future Enhancements
ðŸš€ Implement digital signatures for secure transactions.
ðŸ”— Add peer-to-peer communication for full decentralization.
ðŸ’¡ Improve Proof-of-Work efficiency with a difficulty adjustment mechanism.
